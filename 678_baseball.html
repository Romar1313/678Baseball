	<div>   I am a proud graduate of George Walton Academy located in Monroe, Georgia and during my tenure at GWA I played shortstop and even did a little pitching.  I played there from 2013 - 2019 from middle to high school.  After graduation, I accepted a scholarship at Georgia Highlands College (JUCO) to play two years and then transferred to University of Dayton in Dayton, Ohio from 2022 - 2024.  As a flyer, I played 2nd, short and 3rd base.  I specialize in infield training. </div>

     <p><div> During my college tenure I decided that I wanted to be an owner of a sports facility that would allow young men and women the opportunity to come to a place where they could hone their athletic skills, continue to learn the fundamentals of their sport and be in a place with liked minded individuals that "love the game." </p></div>

	<p>This facility is available for team practices and private lessons.  We aim to teach and enhance skills that will help any player improve his/her game.  We focus on proper techniques, restore and continue the love of the game, mentally work through challenges and having fun doing what you love. The facility is 15,000 sq feet that comprises of live and machine pitching, space to practice fielding, pitching and hitting techniques.  We have full-time staff that is available to assist as needed during team practices, and all our coaches for private lessons are formal collegiate athletes.
